Reflection coefficients:

The reflection coefficient diplays how large part of the pressure wave moving in the tube is reflected back at the junction. For examp
le, of the wave travelling right in tube 1, a portion expressed by k1 is reflected back to the tube 1
, and the rest ( 1-k1) passes on to tube 2.

Reflections coefficients are the menos-PARCOR coefficients in the levinson durvin recursion algorithm, that arises form resolving
a system of equations.
