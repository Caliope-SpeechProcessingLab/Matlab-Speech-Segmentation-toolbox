
Line spectral frequencies is a way of uniquely representing the LPC-coefficients. The motivation behind LSF transformation 
is greater interpolation properties and robustness to quantization.

The LSF values are expressed the angular frequencies or normalized frequencies of the polynomial zeroes from LPC coefficients.

LSF´s usage is popular due to the good quantization characteristics and consequent efficiency of the representation. LSFs collectively 
describe the 2 resonance conditions arising from an interconnected tube model of the human vocal tract.
This include mouth shape and nasal cavity, and forms the basis of the underlying physuological relevance of the linear rediction representation.
The 2 resonance conditions are those that describe the vocal tract being either fully open or fully closed at the glotis respectively.
