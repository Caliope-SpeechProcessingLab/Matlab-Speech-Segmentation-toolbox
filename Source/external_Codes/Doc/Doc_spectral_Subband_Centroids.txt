Esta dentro de aquellos parametros (low level parameterS) espectrales que intentan la estructura del espectro de un frame o señal sonora
usando una única cantidad

Este (centroide espectral) caracteriza el centro de gravedad de la energia espectral

They are suplemmental information to cepstral coefficient.

Formula: 
  
  centroids=sum(k*F[k])/sum(F[k]);

Donde k es un frequency bin.

One of the major problems  with the cepstral  features is that they are very sensitive to additive noise distortion. Addition 
of white noise to the speech signal  affects the speech power spectrum at all the frequencies, 
but the effect  is  less noticable in the higher amplitude (formant) portions of the spectrum 
(i.e., signal-to-noise ratio is more  in 
the formant regions than in the non-formant regions). Since cepstrum features use formant as well as non-formant regions
of the power spectrum in their computation, they become very sensitive to additive noise.
